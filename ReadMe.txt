for increasing the switching frequency.
-Adding 2 volume for adjust the frequency and amplitude.
-Improving SPWM frequency up to 90Hz.
-Improving switching frequency up to 8kHz.
-Adding Moving average for smoothly signal.
-Adding serial communication for debugging;
-Clearing code and detele some unnecessary function.
